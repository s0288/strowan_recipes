# strowan_recipes

* For each new recipe, create a new branch, add the recipe on it and then make a pull request. 
* Python package [lektor](https://pypi.org/project/Lektor/) must be previously installed.

To see the changes on the localhost, run the following commands:
```
lektor build
lektor serve
```

Adjust the url to the format `http://127.0.0.1:5000/20XX/xxx_xxxx/` in order to access the new recipe using the localhost.
